# Job Portal Application
**Tech:** PHP · SQL (MySQL) · CSS

A lightweight job portal for entry-level hiring workflows. Applicants can browse job postings and submit applications, while the system tracks key hiring entities in a relational database, including applications, interview dates, and offer letters. Applicants can also update contact information (like phone number, address) to keep their profile current.

This project was inspired by my own experience navigating job applications and seeing how fragmented and complex hiring workflows can be for both applicants and companies. I wanted to explore how an end-to-end system can manage core hiring processes - job postings, applications, interviews, and offers - efficiently using a relational database.

## Core Features
- Job listings + application submission
- Database-backed tracking for:
  - applications
  - interview scheduling dates
  - offer letters
- Applicant profile/contact updates (phone number, address)
- Simple, accessible navigation intended for small hiring teams

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL (added SQL schema/scripts)
- **Styling:** CSS
